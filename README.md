# About

>Over the years, I have saved various ticket stubs from concerts I have attended. Here, I have created a browser that displays the ticket stub, some event information, various random details I happen to rememeber about the show, and setlist information.

>Open localhost:3000 on your web browser. Scroll the ticket list and click a ticket to see the show information.
